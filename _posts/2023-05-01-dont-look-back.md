# Get used to eustress

You do need the aggravation. Yes, aggravation is aggravating -- but you NEED the eustress. Mentally, intellectually ... *you need the PUSH of thinking like you are going to need to attack*.

# Embrace the SUCK of getting old

Stop thinking that you are going to die. You will die when you die -- ***don't think your way into pre-dying!***

If you ditch alcohol, stop cramming the standard American diet down your piehole, get your [Glucose Ketone Index](https://cancerv.me/2019/10/25/the-complete-guide-to-glucose-ketone-index-gki-tracking-for-therapeutic-ketosis/) generally down into therapeutic levels [to avoid cancer as well as mosquitos/ticks and disease], practice decent sleep hygiene, exercise every day, spend more time outside, successfully avoid medications, undoctor yourself from all medical easy buttons ... you'll probably live a lot better and you are actually going to HAVE TO live better because it's sorta likely that *when you* ***attack life*** *rather than settling for being a victim of everything that you imagine to be persecuting you*, **you'll be very much alive past 100**.
