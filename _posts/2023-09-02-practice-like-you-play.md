# Continuously ELEVATE your discipline

You can elevate clouds. Elevation must be concrete and grounded in your current reality. Elevation must lift from the mass of where you currently are -- the start cannot be one bit theoretical; you cannot lift from what you desire or hope for ... you start where you are elevation has to be the HARD way. You cannot have somebody else elevate for you; you cannot ask someone to give it to you ... elevation is entirely on YOU.

***You have to start where you are.*** There is simply no other way. 

You have to reach down and lift yourself up by your own effort ... before you can even think about elevating, you have to get real about assessing where you are.

Your current discipline is whatever it is ... you cannot fix the past that got you here ... but ELEVATING your level of discipline begins with the earnest intention to elevate yourself to whatever your Creator intended you to become ... after that, it will be the actual second-by-second execution of that intention to *elevate FROM WHERE YOU ARE* ... elevation of discipline is HARD.


# Brainstorm The Discipline of Brainstorming

To really brainstorm your practice of elevation, you will need to PUSH a bit on your current envelope of ideas ... it's all about building the discipline of brainstorming itself.

We cannot afford to just look at the top three or five as we normally do with *googlestorming* ideation. We really need to ***PUSH*** a bit harder and think ... or maybe daydream, or *BRAINSTORM* how we might improve brainstorming itself in the modern world of AI-assisted ideation.

To brainstorm, we want to have roughly 125 pretty good ideas in the hopper ... we will try to get to each of these GOOD ideas sometime in the next 3 months, but the lower 100 will always be *on the bubble* as we ideate a better set of 100. 

The 25 keepers will most important list items we work on at least once a month.

Our top five list ... which might be closer to what everyone tends to think of as a *normal* ToDo list are those top five things that we will touch on at least once in the coming week.

Of course, our focus will be one the ONE main one ... the biggie that we are really focusing on, trying to get right.
