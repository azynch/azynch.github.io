# Fundamentals (50 modules):

0: Before you start down the Rust-Lang portion of this program of study, [carefully review the reasons WHY you want to use Rust-Lang](https://g.co/gemini/share/539967298e84), because [C-Lang is likely to remain the dominant force in low-level programming long into the foreseeable future](https://g.co/gemini/share/87dc72e2cb30) because Rust-Lang will offer compelling advantages in some aspects, but there will always be important niches where C's raw control and established ecoystem are irreplaceable. If you decide to go down the Rust-Lang paty, you will want to think about those ways for [expeditiously ascending the Rust-Lang learning curve](https://g.co/gemini/share/3c9d44a968dc) that make the most sense for you getting up to speed as rapidly as possible.

1: [Installation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html), test the installation with [Hello, World!](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-02-hello-world.html), review Rust program anatomy especially the main() function with the body wrapped in {}, experiment a bit with [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) tool for formatting Rust code according to style guidelines, but also take a quick look at the other [Rust development tools](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-04-useful-development-tools.html) such as [rustfix](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-04-useful-development-tools.html#fix-your-code-with-rustfix), the [rust-clippy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/clippy/) collection of [over 700 lints](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html), the [rust-analyzer extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer), compile and run, note that Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, then experiment with Rust's [Cargo build system and package manager](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html) and skim over [The Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/). 

2-10: Rust basics - syntax, data types, variables, functions, control flow 
11-20: Ownership, borrowing, lifetimes 
21-30: Structs, enums, pattern matching
31-35: Error handling, Option, Result 
36-40: Modules, crates, workspaces
41-45: Testing, debugging, documentation
46-50: Standard library, common collections

# Systems Programming (40 modules):
51-60: Memory layout, pointers, unsafe Rust
61-65: Concurrency, threads, sync primitives 
66-70: Parallelism, rayon, crossbeam
71-75: FFI, linking to C code
76-80: Allocators, custom allocators
81-90: Performance, profiling, optimization 

# Embedded & Real-Time Systems (40 modules):
91-100: Embedded basics, no_std, memory-mapped registers
101-105: Interrupts, exceptions, fault handling
106-110: Device drivers, I/O 
111-120: Real-time scheduling, RTOS concepts
121-125: Time handling, clocks, timers
126-130: Predictability, worst-case execution time

# WebAssembly & Tauri (20 modules): 
131-135: WebAssembly basics, Rust to WASM
136-140: JavaScript interop, wasm-bindgen
141-145: Tauri fundamentals, project setup
146-150: UI development with Tauri

# Robotics & ROS2 (30 modules):
151-160: Robotics fundamentals, kinematics, control
161-165: Sensors, actuators, interfacing
166-170: ROS2 architecture, nodes, topics
171-175: Navigation, path planning, obstacle avoidance 
176-180: Computer vision, image processing

# Distributed Systems (20 modules):
181-185: Distributed algorithms, consensus, gossip
186-190: Fault tolerance, replication, sharding
191-195: Networking, protocols, message passing
196-200: Security, authentication, encryption



WebAssembly and Tauri are included to enable UI development and potential off-loading of computation. The robotics portion covers essential concepts and ROS2 integration.

Finally, distributed systems modules prepare for the challenges of swarm robotics, such as coordination, resilience, and security. Extensive practice projects and coding exercises should accompany the theoretical material.

This is an intensive curriculum but provides a thorough foundation for the ambitious goal of building fault-tolerant real-time operating systems for robot swarms. The exact content can be adapted based on prior experience and specific project requirements. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of the curriculum!
