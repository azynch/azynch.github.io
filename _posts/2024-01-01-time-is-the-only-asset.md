AZYNCH is ASYNCHRONOUS communication ... 

The WHOLE point of AZYNCH is making it possible for you to CONTROL your own life ... without being a slave to some job that requires you synchronously work with others and attend meetings with others per others' schedule ... such that you only have a small portion of life, ie a few hours a day, that you actually get to CONTROL.

What asynchonous communication workflows really MEANS is that ALL of our workflow communications with one another in our working projects have to become an extension of our MINDFULLNESS-based [cognitive behavior therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) sessions, ie it's not just *some* of the time, we can't afford to be that lazy emotionally or mentally -- it's ALL of the time that we are working on ourselves, on our communication discipline. 

Asynchronoous communication DEMANDS that everyone participating ***genuinely*** seeks to understand where the other person is coming from -- practically, this means that everyone errs on the side of too much information or OVERCOMMUNICATES.

**Why?**... per [Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law), **all organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.** 

Four example, when you have four separate tight-knit groups, eg four geographic team locations in which the programmers on each team sychronously at formal meetings AND serendipitously [in the hall or breakroom between meetings] ***communicate*** as well as communicate virtually via teleconference/email/webconferencing with other teams also working on the compiler, you should expect to get something like 4-pass compiler, because that is GUARANTEED to emerge as the most tractable way to manage responsibilities and the tightness of interactions ... the organization has to be compatible with the product architecture AND the product architecture has to be compatible with the organization's need.

ASYNCHRONOUS communication is NOT for everyone ... not for all purposes, eg not for building a Tesla EV ... because it is about about transcending ALL boundaries of time or space. ASYNCHRONOUS communication HAS TO BE about cognitive communication flow engineering, ie not just the boss or the boss's aides, *not just Elon, not just Elon's lieutenants,* but EVERYBODY has take responsibility for listening and communicating AND for doing it better tomorrow, next week, next month ... there's ZERO room for ever just assuming that somebody ***physically present, in the meeting*** actually *got it* ... the acknowledgement's need to be more EXPLICIT and it's not acceptable for one side to always be asking the other side for the explicit acknowledgement. 

ASYNCHRONOUS communication ***EVERYBODY*** needs to pull their weight in the cognitive communication flow engineering. ***EVERYBODY*** has to be a mature ADULT, ie no babysitting.
