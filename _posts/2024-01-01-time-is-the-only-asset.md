AZYNCH is ASYNCHRONOUS communication ... this means that ALL of our communications with one another have to be an extension of our MINDFULLNESS-based [cognitive behavior therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) sessions, ie we are always working on ourselves, on our communications.

Why?... per [Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law), all organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations. When you have four separate tight-knit groups, eg four geographic team locations in which the programmers on each team serendipitously communicate as well as communicate via teleconference/email with other teams also working on the compiler, you should expect to get a 4-pass compiler, because that is the most tractable way to manage responsibilities and tight interactions ... the organization has to be compatible with the product architecture AND the product architecture has to be compatible with the organization's need.

ASYNCHRONOUS communication is NOT for everyone ... because it is about about transcending ALL boundaries of time or space; ASYNCHRONOUS communication HAS TO BE about cognitive communication flow engineering, ie EVERYBODY has take responsibility for listening and communicating; there's ZERO for just assuming that somebody on the side *got it* ... the acknowledgement's need to be EXPLICIT and it's not acceptable for one side to ask the other side for the explicit acknowledgement


# You get 86400 secs/day, 30 or 31 days/month.

Some time mgmt systems are based on using EVERY second, ie people will have meetings scheduled for the full day; maybe they will have two or three meetings scheduled.

In ASYCHRONOUS communication, we flat out REFUSE to schedule something for every second of the day ... because multitasking nothing but either a LIE, or worse, something DANGEROUS and likely to get people killed.

Nobody has a multitasking kind of attention span ... people tell themselves lies when they imagine that they can multitask ... instead, we try to push everyone involved to FOCUS on the team's issue according to the individual's own schedule and by better focusing on one task at hand, professionals can legitimately REALLY USE every second as it is passes ... rather than bouncing around on multitudes of tasks and NEVER really focusing on their responsibility to review the issue and react accordingly.

If we really want to be USING our time effectively ... **we can't be wasting time on meetings or similar babysitting sessions for people who are supposed to be ADULT professionals** ... the time-wastiness of meetings is a big part of WHY we use ASYNCHRONOUS communication ... *because we REALLY can't be wasting time on meetings themselves OR everything that we must do in order to block off time in the calendar for a meeting or for commuting to a meeting, even if it's a virtual commute, it still involves opening up a Zoom, making sure the mic/video are working and waiting around.*

This reallys means that if we want ASYNCHRONOUS communication, then everyone has to agree beforehand to not just overcommunicate but to assume part of the role of disciplinarian for ensuring that everyone else overcommunicates. Overcommunicating is necessary, because we can grok screenfuls of text and we can all see emojis, acronyms and expected responses ... so, when we're doing ASYNCHRONOUS communication, we can't be wasting time on waiting for responses--we just need that emoji or acronym or a lengthier discussion ... and if we don't get it, we ALL need ask, "Hey! Are you alive?" 
 
If want ASYNCHRONOUS communication, everyone has to communicate THE RIGHT WAY [per what the team has agreed will be the right way] AND ONLY IN THE RIGHT WAY ... for example, if the conversation is about an issue, it needs to be attached to the issue, ie no tolerance for private DM side-channel chats about issues when the issue is in the issue tracker.

In ASYNCHRONOOUS communications, it will feel [to people used to synchronous meetings] that everybody is OVERCOMMUNICATING ... that's how it HAS TO BE ... because in projects, teams, organizations that are characterized by ASYNCHRONOUS communcation flows, there are ALMOST NO meetings ... there's no immediate response or non-verbal feedback or anything that could be interpreted as agreement ... so it's NECESSARY to not tolerate non-response, ie if you're part of the team, there has to be SOME response from you within the agreed time period OR ELSE somebody else on the team has to ASK, "Are you alive?"

This is effectively SOCIAL mindfulness-based cognitive behavior therapy ... it's about EVERY TEAM MEMBER being aware of the cognitive communication flow and EVERY TEAM MEMBER taking repsonsibility for improving cognitive communication flow engineering that the team uses to make the ASYNCHRONOUS communication work.

## Standard responses ... STANDARDS = time savings

Emojis üòäüëçüî• ... just [be sure that EVERYONE involved will read the emoji, from your team's STANDARD EMOJI LIBRARY, exactly the same way](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/small-talk-and-big-questions/202304/the-problem-with-emojis), ie there's NO ROOM FOR SARCASM! Because everyone's TIME matters too much for just joking around!
