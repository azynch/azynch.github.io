# Somebody else has found a better way.

Somewhere, someone else has found a cheaper, quicker, handier way ... just like your old house, your old shit might still work just fine perfectly fine, but now there's a cheap, quick, handy, SMARTER way around the old problem that your old shit used to solve.  There might not be a good reason to dispose of it, but you don't need to replace your old shit as long as it still generally works. 

The point is don't over-invest in keeping your old shit in pristine condition ... unless you're trying to put the lipstick on your old pig and peddle your antiques to a new owner who's into old shit.

# You will need better friends, so get better at making friends with more productive people.

Yeah, we all get by with a little help from our friends ... but we might not push ourselves to be better, more useful, more productive friends.

There's usually no reason to dispose of old friends, except for those who want to be friends with the old you -- when you focus on being the new you, your new friends will sort themselves in/out of your life ... but you do need to develop the skills of making NEW friends and renewing old friendships with people who will push you a bit to develop more productive, more useful future friendships ... it cannot be emphasized enough that you need to ***LET THE DEAD BURY THEIR DEAD.***
