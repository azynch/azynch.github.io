Let's start off with the entirely outrageous claim that ***working in the realm of [cognitive radio (CR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_radio) for [autonomous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_robot) [real-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing) [fault tolerant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tolerance) [swarm robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_robotics) is actually a means of training for meditative awareness.***  

*Yeah, that's OBVIOUSLY a* ***total stretch*** *... but let's think about what that would mean ...*  

### How we LEARN immersively is the key to how we WILL think

*We should never stop learning IMMERSIVELY ...* ... in fact we should accelerate the plunge in [immersive learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersive_learning) so that a portion of our brain is continually in that mode of learning how to speak, to hear, what to watch and how we learned to THINK and be aware of our cognitive strategies in our [first] ***native language***.

Consider the following proposed 200-module training regimen [given below] for a year-long deep plunge *off the deeper sort of deep ends* into [learning to ***think like a native*** in the Rust programming language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) with a focus on developing programming capabilities and toolchains for working in [predictive fault-tolerance in real-time operating systems [RTOS] for swarm robotics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.09309.pdf) which might include developing the capability to [incorporate the latest thinking research to optimize cognitive radio](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=%22cognitive+radio%22&searchtype=all&source=header) for RT-FT swarm robotics.

Per the ORIGINAL PLAN for our immersive learning plunge, the modules almost appear to be designed to progressively build skills, starting with Rust fundamentals, then moving into lower-level systems concepts crucial for RTOS development, followed by a deeper plunge into embedded and real-time modules that dive deeper into the specifics of constrained environments and deterministic execution ...

***EXCEPT*** this is immersive training that gets more progressively immersive, so we're certainly not going to just STICK WITH the original plan ... we live in an AI-enabled age, so we are going to try to learn by IMMERSION ... that means trying to skim over and grok the entire syllabus in a week or a couple weeks or maybe a month at most ... but we are going to drink from the firehose.

*Of course, it's perfectly okay to revise/extend the syllabus as we go along BUT ...*

## THE SYLLABUS BRINGS US BACK TO CENTER

At some point, when we have really squeezed all the just out of the ol' lemon, we are going to ask our AI assistant an UPDATED VERSION of our original question to furnish us with a new, improved, updated syllabus *although we will keep the old one for reference*.

    "Please develop a 200 module training regimen for a year-long deep dive into learning to program with Rust-Lang, including WASM, the Tauri application toolkit, ROS2 with Rust bindings and other intracies of Rust-Lang and getting closer to the machine. The general objective for this year-long training regimen should be in the realm of developing the capabilities and toolchain for developing fault-tolerant real-time operating systems for swarm robotics."

The POINT of this exercise is IMMERSION ... and overwhelming ourselves with an understanding of the topic ... in order to be able to ask progressively better question.

# Fundamentals (50 modules):

0: Before you start down the Rust-Lang portion of this program of study, [carefully review the reasons WHY you want to use Rust-Lang](https://g.co/gemini/share/539967298e84), because [C-Lang is likely to remain the dominant force in low-level programming long into the foreseeable future](https://g.co/gemini/share/87dc72e2cb30) because Rust-Lang will offer compelling advantages in some aspects, but there will always be important niches where C's raw control and established ecoystem are irreplaceable. If you decide to go down the Rust-Lang paty, you will want to think about those ways for [expeditiously ascending the Rust-Lang learning curve](https://g.co/gemini/share/3c9d44a968dc) that make the most sense for you getting up to speed as rapidly as possible.

1: [Installation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html), test the installation with [Hello, World!](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-02-hello-world.html), review Rust program anatomy especially the main() function with the body wrapped in {}, experiment a bit with [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) tool for formatting Rust code according to style guidelines, but also take a quick look at the other [Rust development tools](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-04-useful-development-tools.html) such as [rustfix](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-04-useful-development-tools.html#fix-your-code-with-rustfix), the [rust-clippy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/clippy/) collection of [over 700 lints](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html), the [rust-analyzer extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer), compile and run, note that Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, then experiment with Rust's [Cargo build system and package manager](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html) and skim over [The Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).

Finally, distributed systems modules prepare for the challenges of swarm robotics, such as coordination, resilience, and security. Extensive practice projects and coding exercises should accompany the theoretical material.

This is an intensive curriculum but provides a thorough foundation for the ambitious goal of building fault-tolerant real-time operating systems for robot swarms. The exact content can be adapted based on prior experience and specific project requirements. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of the curriculum!
