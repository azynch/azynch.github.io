Ditch your OLD self's ego! Stop living in the past ... above all, do not wish to go back to your drunk self's view that life was better back in margaritaville -- stop being a crybaby, ***SOBER THE LIVING EFF UP!***

Stop assuming that you have to follow an arbitrary time structure.

# Time structures now allow for humans to be independent

If you really want to be independent and not simply trade one master for another you will need to take full control of your time, including the implicity time structures that you keep ... in other words, independence necessarily requires you to fully embrace ASYNCHRONICITY and define your time structures as something that is dependent upon your WHY.

Embracing ASYNCHRONICITY means that you can collaborate with anyone, anywhere, anytime ... which makes it even more imperative that you **manage your own time** and, above all, ***be much more focused on YOUR WHY***. *Stop settling for masters who demand that you kowtow to their agenda.*
