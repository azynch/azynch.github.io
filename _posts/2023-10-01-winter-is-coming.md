# Cold therapy is about LIVING outside

It's not about some candyass shiny tub filled with ice ... that's a trendy bovine crowd thing, like bitcoin ... trends are for those who like following trends.

*Cold adapt* by keeping your house at 50F in the Winter and spending most of your day OUTSIDE. Get more UV in Winter, especially since ticks/mosquitos are not a factor ... GET OUTSIDE ... a lot more in Winter.

# Live to be 100

It's really about what you remove:

* Fast; eat right; to get your GKI down to therapeutuic levels.
* Get practical, OUTDOOR exercise; walk a lot more; do REAL shit.
* Ditch your EGO; let go of attachments and even your friendships.
* Enjoy the cold for its excellence at just being really cold.
* Plan your day to get great sleep, rather than too much of it.

***Winter Will Be Longer Than You Expect***
