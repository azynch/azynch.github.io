# Celebrate Love and Joy

There's no better example of God's love and the joy we should have than the sacrifice than Jesus Christ. NONE.

Don't dilute or ruin the point of season of Joy by making the season about gifts. Jesus was born and LIVED every second in order to be a sacrifice. Contemplate that lesson.

# AVOID people who are focuse on material shit and decorations

Sacrifice is really about everything that you gain when you remove the mindlessness stopping you from seeing the best point of your life. ***Rather than asking your desired day; pray instead that you are able to understand the perfection of the day you have been given.***

* Ditch your EGO; let go of your attachments your old ways, including your ties to materialists ... you don't need stuff and you really don't need humans who are stuff-centric.

* Plan your day to get exercise and accomplish things that matter to you so that you are stress free and get the perfect amount of great sleep at night.

* Get practical, OUTDOOR exercise; walk a LOT more; [5S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5S_(methodology)) or do REAL shit that provides a sense of accomplishment.

* Push your [GKI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4367849/) [down to 3 or lower](https://perfectketo.com/glucose-ketone-index/); FAST; then eat RIGHT.

* Enjoy the cold when the weather is too cold for others for cold weather's excellence at being great at what COLD does. Enjoy the heat when the weather is too hot for others for hot weather's excellence at being great at what HEAT does.
