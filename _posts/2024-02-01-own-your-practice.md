Of course, you should be aware of the best asynchronous tools and automation ... you don't have to reinvent the whole wheel, you should steal the very best ideas that proving themselves for others ... because they're simpler, better, more reliable and just seem  to work better ... reinventing EVERYTHING is not required, but you can focus on tailoring the stuff that matters, because ***you must OWN your practice.*** 

***Asynchronous means that you are an ADULT who is capable of developing ADULT toolchain to accomplish ADULT projects; being*** **capable of an asynchronous workflow** ***means NO BABYSITTERS ARE NECESSARY.***

You must OWN every bit of who you are -- that includes building your own tools.

You especially have to polish, maintain, upgrade, level up, refurbish and improve those undisciplined little parts of you that you are working on. Never mind your house or your car or your guns or any of your stuff -- OWNING your practice is about YOU.

Improving YOUR discipline is about the meta-programming skill of how you go about internalizing through repitition and improving everything in the execution of everything in the discipline of your practice, including anything you do every day to tinker with, critique, self-coach and refactor the automation you OWN and use to support your time management discipline.

# Asynchronous Communication Tools
 
[Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/getting-started/introduction#what-is-jira-software) for bug tracking, issue tracking and agile project management ... and [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/resources/guides/best-practices/project-collaboration#overview), the web-based corporate wiki enterprise knowledge management system were the top two async tools amongst ALL developers, but particularly professional developers, in the [StackOverflow 2023 survey of asynchronous developers](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-most-popular-technologies-asynchronous-tools) ... but it interesting that just using ordinary markdown files also broke top three; do this is maybe even more common than the survey indicates, since some might not even think of using markdown, either with a static website generator like Jekyll or Hugo OR just in the comments on issues on GitHub/GitLab, as being a ***tool***. People who are learning to code rely upon [GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions) more than markdown files; noobs also tend ot turn to products like the [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), freemium note-taking web application for task management, project tracking, to-do lists, and bookmarking.(26%) or [Trello](https://trello.com/), the freemium web-based, kanban-style, list-making application.
