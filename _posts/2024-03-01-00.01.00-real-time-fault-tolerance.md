# Fundamentals (50 modules):

0: Before you EVEN start down the Rust-Lang portion of this program of study, [carefully review the reasons WHY you want to use Rust-Lang](https://g.co/gemini/share/539967298e84), because [C-Lang is likely to remain the dominant force in low-level programming long into the foreseeable future](https://g.co/gemini/share/87dc72e2cb30). Rust-Lang is offering compelling advantages in some aspects, since memory safety is indeed one of the most significant concerns in programming. But that is recognized now, but many writing code in the C programming language, even if the C standard does not [in its current form] inherently provide memory safety. The responsibility of ensuring memory safety largely falls on the C developer, but that will change. The developer can use development tools that aid in memory safety; there are people working on changes [driven by memory safety issue] to the language/compiler and libraries. It's certainly not foolproof, but [packaging several features into profiles can do ***much*** [although far from everything] to enforce memory safety](https://g.co/gemini/share/c49b6967474b). Developers can follow certain practices to achieve memory safety, such as: a) [nulling out pointers when freeing memory to avoid Use-After-Free bugs and double free bugs](https://g.co/gemini/share/ff0bed4ab86e), b) [performing bound checks to avoid Out-Of-Bounds (OOB) read and write vulnerabilities](https://g.co/gemini/share/39a0c582ef8f). c) [avoiding recursion or using it within known limits to prevent Stack Exhaustion and Heap Exhaustion vulnerabilities](https://g.co/gemini/share/cad42032c5d4). Although *practices* can help, they do not guarantee memory safety to the degree that Rust-Lang can. But there's a **LOT** of C code out there already and it's not going away soon, partly because ***even*** [high-level programming will not soon be replaced by conversational AI](https://g.co/gemini/share/de1515337e6c), there will always be important niches where C's raw control and established ecoystem are irreplaceable for troubleshooting issues in low-level programming. It is probably worth going down the Rust-Lang path as a novice or journeyman, even if one does not start out with an aim for mastery. It is strongly recommended that one working in this area be a *knows-just enough-to-dangerous* polyglot, ie there are topics in machine learning, AI and large language models that call for at least being able to follow a serious discussion in the Python ecosystem, you will want to think about those ways for [expeditiously ascending the Rust-Lang learning curve](https://g.co/gemini/share/3c9d44a968dc) that make the most sense for you getting up to speed as rapidly as possible.

1: [Installation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html), test the installation with [Hello, World!](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-02-hello-world.html), review Rust program anatomy especially the main() function with the body wrapped in {}, experiment a bit with [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) tool for formatting Rust code according to style guidelines, but also take a quick look at the other [Rust development tools](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-04-useful-development-tools.html) such as [rustfix](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-04-useful-development-tools.html#fix-your-code-with-rustfix), the [rust-clippy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/clippy/) collection of [over 700 lints](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html), the [rust-analyzer extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer), compile and run, note that Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, then experiment with Rust's [Cargo build system and package manager](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html) and skim over [The Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).

WebAssembly and Tauri are included to enable UI development and potential off-loading of computation. The robotics portion covers essential concepts and ROS2 integration.

Finally, distributed systems modules prepare for the challenges of swarm robotics, such as coordination, resilience, and security. Extensive practice projects and coding exercises should accompany the theoretical material.

This is an intensive curriculum but provides a thorough foundation for the ambitious goal of building fault-tolerant real-time operating systems for robot swarms. The exact content can be adapted based on prior experience and specific project requirements. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of the curriculum!
