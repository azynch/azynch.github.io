The goal is to provide a comprehensive, but not exhaustive, curriculum that will enable the learner to build a solid foundation in Rust-Lang, WebAssembly, Tauri, ROS2, and distributed systems.

It is intended to be an intensive, immersive, yet thorough and well-rounded curriculum to provide the foundational skills for a goal of building fault-tolerant real-time operating systems for robot swarms. 

As we go along through this material, we will want to be searching extensively, exhaustively for inexpensive demonstration or prototype-level projects and development communities that are working in areas tangentially related to the theoretical study outlined in this syllabus. Of course, the exact content for any self-starting autodidact can be adapted based on that individual's prior experience and their specific learning requirements. 

# Fundamentals (50 modules):

0: **Before we EVEN start** down the Rust-Lang portion of this program of study, it's spend some time [carefully reviewing the reasons WHY anyone would want to use Rust-Lang](https://g.co/gemini/share/539967298e84) ... maybe, we will come away from this thinking that this course should really be much more heavily based on C-Lang, although we will get into plenty of legacy C code along the way, as we work through examples and ask our AI assistants to help us understand why something is done as it is in C-Lang. [C-Lang is likely to remain the dominant force in low-level programming long into the foreseeable future](https://g.co/gemini/share/87dc72e2cb30). 

Rust-Lang is offering seriously compelling advantages over C-Lang in some aspects, since memory safety is going to remain one of the most significant concerns in programming. That has been recognized for some time [thus Rust-Lang came into existence], but many writing code in the C programming language, even if the C standard does not [in its current form] inherently provide memory safety. The responsibility of ensuring memory safety in C largely falls on the C developer, but that will change with standards and automation. The C-Lang developer can use C development tools that aid in memory safety; there are scads of bright people working on changes to C [driven by memory safety issue] to the language/compiler and libraries. 

It's certainly not foolproof, BUT ***developing memory safe code is not impossible*** ... for example, [packaging several features into profilers can do ***much*** [although far from everything that Rust-Lang does] to enforce memory safety](https://g.co/gemini/share/c49b6967474b). Developers can follow certain practices [and set up their toolchains accordingly] to achieve memory safety, such as: a) [nulling out pointers when freeing memory to avoid Use-After-Free bugs and double free bugs](https://g.co/gemini/share/ff0bed4ab86e), b) [performing bound checks to avoid Out-Of-Bounds (OOB) read and write vulnerabilities](https://g.co/gemini/share/39a0c582ef8f). c) [avoiding recursion or using it within known limits to prevent Stack Exhaustion and Heap Exhaustion vulnerabilities](https://g.co/gemini/share/cad42032c5d4). Although *practices* can help, they do not guarantee memory safety to the degree that Rust-Lang can. 

The thing is, there's a **LOT** of C code out there already and it's not going away soon, partly because ***even*** [high-level programming will not soon be replaced by conversational AI](https://g.co/gemini/share/de1515337e6c), there will always be important niches where C's raw control and established ecoystem are irreplaceable for troubleshooting issues in low-level programming. It is probably worth going down the Rust-Lang path as a novice or journeyman, even if one does not start out with an aim for mastery. 

It's not really about the C vs Rust programming language argument ... because we all need to be *conversant* in different languages and idioms ... it's the interactions with the larger POPULATION of developers writing code that matters. It is strongly recommended that one working in this area engage in [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) to communicate ideas. One example of this idea of being enough of a polyglot to be able to communicate the dangerous gist of an idea to others is [.NET Interactive](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive) and [**POLYGLOT** ***notebookers***](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/polyglot) which allow us to programmatically demonstrate ideas and use [diagrams-as-code](https://github.com/topics/diagrams-as-code?o=desc&s=forks) tools like [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/) for [sankey flow diagrams](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/sankey.html), [gitgraphs](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/gitgraph.html), [mind maps](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/mindmap.html). 

There are interesting and important conversations happening now in areas like machine learning, AI and large language models that really sort of call for one at least being able to follow [and ask useful clarifying questions in] a serious discussion happening in some corner of the larger polyglot ecosystem ... when it comes to learning languages ***which is really about understanding how people who express ideas in those languages think***, we will want to think about those ways for [expeditiously ascending the Rust-Lang learning curve](https://g.co/gemini/share/3c9d44a968dc) that make the most sense for us in IMMERSING ourselves in the language and getting up to speed as rapidly as possible.

1: [Preliminaries: Basic Installation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html) ... start with the normally recommended [rustup](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/concepts/index.html) basic installation process and invoke [rustc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/what-is-rustc.html) to compile and then run the ["Hello, World!" example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/hello.html), which means that you need to ensure that you have everything ready to go. At first, you're just going to get a start with Rust program anatomy, including things like [comments](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/hello/comment.html) or additional *junk* code you care to add, just to monkey around ... the NECESSITY of monkeying around with the hello_world program can't be stressed enough; after all, this is a just sandbox; so [read ahead to *learn ahead of the class*, do things when you don't know what you're doing, look over other examples upon [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html)] but, be sure to add stupid stuff and find different ways to ***break*** the simple program.You want to come away from this with some vague sense of how Rust checks formatting correctness at compile time, noting that Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language and uses linters. You will especially want to notice *and break* the syntax of main() function with the body wrapped in {} and the [formatted print](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/hello/print.html). 

Add different kinds of junk filler code ... just to experimenting a bit with [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) tool for formatting Rust code according to style guidelines. But also take a quick overview look at the other [Rust development tools](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-04-useful-development-tools.html) such as [rustfix](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-04-useful-development-tools.html#fix-your-code-with-rustfix) and [rust-clippy tool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/clippy/index.html), with its collection of [over 700 lints](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html). You can master these ***later***, but at first you want to RAPIDLY get a very high level overview of the [rust-analyzer extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) as well as other Rust-related extensions for VSCode, such as [CodeLLDB](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb) and by all means if you use VSCode, be SURE to ALSO work through [the tutorial for using Rust within VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust) to *start* getting a sense of how you might eventually get a feel for [how VSCode can be used for Rust development](https://g.co/gemini/share/1526dd613f89). 

Be sure to compile and run trial example programs beyond just [Hello, World!](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/hello.html). Then experiment with Rust's [Cargo build system and package manager](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html) and skim over [The Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/). The POINT of getting way ahead of yourself in the **Preliminary** module is to go wild, explore how much you can learn in just one day ... don't worry about getting it down perfectly, you will not have ***really*** broken anything -- we will be coming back to this material again and again ... at first, just install Rust, compile and run the hello_world program, drink from the firehose and ... ***BREAK THINGS.***

2-10: Start scratching the surface of how Rust actually works by methodically going through each one of the exercises in [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/) the *right way* ... because [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/) is going to be the best way for large audiences of Rust noobs to assuredly learn the most basic basics of fundamental programming in Rust. While you are going through the exercises, you will want to use [***The Rust Programming Language*** book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html), the most comprehensive and theoretically deep resource for exploring concepts. You will also want to rely upon [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html) for practical ideas for alternative examples to tie all of the concepts together so that you might firmly understand [common programming concepts, keywords and syntax](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-00-common-programming-concepts.html),[variables and mutability](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html), [data types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html), [functions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-03-how-functions-work.html), [comments](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-04-comments.html), [control flow](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-05-control-flow.html).
