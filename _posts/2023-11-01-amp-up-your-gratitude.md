# Celebrate Thanksgiving

There's only one holiday a year that is about gratitude -- you can afford to spend 30 days being extra grateful.

You don't need to spend any days of the year stuffing yourself. You probably will get lots of opportunities to feast, so the lay the fuck off on the massive eating competitions.

# Reconnect with your WHY

Gratitude is really about what you gain when you remove your mindless excesses:

* Fast; eat right; to get your GKI down to therapeutuic levels.
* Get practical, OUTDOOR exercise; walk a lot more; do REAL shit.
* Ditch your EGO; let go of attachments and even your friendships.
* Enjoy the cold for its excellence at just being really cold.
* Plan your day to get great sleep, rather than too much of it.

***Winter Will Be Longer Than You Expect***
