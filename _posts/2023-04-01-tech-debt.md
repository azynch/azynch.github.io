# Get used to not being able to keep up with technical debt

That's the way you want it ... having increasing technical debt means that you are still improving, still growing.

# Embrace the SUCK of not being able to keep up

Embracing the certainty of increasing technical debt is a necessary but not sufficient condition for embracing ASYNCHRONICITY.  

Not only must you must take charge of your own skillset, habits, disciplines so that are able to collaborate with the future you ... OR so that you are better able to communicate with anyone, anywhere, anytime ... you have to understand that it will always feel like you are not quite good enough, like you are maybe missing something, like you are falling behind.

*Get used to it!* ***You actually want INCREASING technical debt.*** You actually want to be part of building the foundations that make things better for all ... even though the tendency is to coast OR even *escape to margaritaville*...

If it was not already painfully obvious BEFORE, embracing asynchronicity makes it even more imperative that you take charge of **managing your own time** and, above all, ***being much more focused on YOUR WHY***. *Stop settling for masters who demand that you kowtow to their agenda ... KNOW YOUR WHY.*
