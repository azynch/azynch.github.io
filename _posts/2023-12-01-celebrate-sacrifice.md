# Celebrate Sacrifice

There's no better example of sacrifice than Jesus Christ. NONE.

Don't dilute or ruin the point of The Gift by making the season about gifts. Jesus was born and LIVED every second in order to be a sacrifice. Contemplate that lesson.

# AVOID people who are focuse on material shit and decorations

Sacrifice is really about what you gain when you remove the mindlessness stopping you from seeing the point of your life. 

* Fast; eat ONLY the right stuff; get your GKI down, down, down.
* Get practical, OUTDOOR exercise; walk a lot more; do REAL shit.
* Ditch your EGO; let go of attachments and even your friendships.
* Enjoy the cold for its excellence at just being really cold.
* Plan your day to get great sleep, rather than too much of it.

***Winter Will Be A LOT Longer Than You Expect***
