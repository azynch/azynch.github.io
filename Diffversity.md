## ACCELERATED IMMERSION and DIFFVERSITY

Diffversity is our approach to continual, lifelong education in order to prepare for a world of even more rapid change ... in a nutshell, it's all about continually gathering CURRENT intelligence and knowledge about the DIFFERENCES that will be shaping the world around us ... it's about developing the tools of knowledge engineering in order help us learn to be more present, to listen better, to be more empathetic, to ask better questions and to HELP OTHERS to make better decisions.

Let's start off with an example ... consider the entirely outrageous claim that ***working in the realm of [cognitive radio (CR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_radio) for [autonomous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_robot) [real-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing) [fault tolerant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tolerance) [swarm robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_robotics) is actually a means of training for meditative awareness.***  

*Yeah, that's OBVIOUSLY a* ***total stretch*** *... but let's think about how that system would function in a chaotic battlefield environment ... and what that kind of thinking would mean in our lives ...* 

**Diffversity** is about the [hormesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormesis) of mental or cognitive [dose-response relationships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose%E2%80%93response_relationship) ... pushing the DIFFERENCES is all about [accelerating our stress screening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highly_accelerated_stress_audit) to understand our ability to [perform at a high level of quality under stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_testing) ... nobody ***loses their religion*** when they are preaching to the choir; the nasty side comes out when people step on a Lego in the dark.

**Diffversity** is based the idea that we can learn to think better by immersing ourselves in the most difficult, challenging, complex and HARD problems that we can find ... but we probably *learn best* when we can do so in a manner in which we can be relatively sure that we'll survive the difficulty, ie it doesn't really advance our cause to have everyone DIE from the learning experience ... troubleshooting issues to understand how systems respond will be HARD, but it has to a very PRACTICAL and HANDS-ON experience ... because *learning to think* about frustrating problems helps us to be more present, more empathetic, more aware and more focused.

## How we learn IMMERSIVELY is the key to how we WILL think

*We should never stop learning IMMERSIVELY ...* ... in fact we should accelerate the plunge in [immersive learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersive_learning) so that a portion of our brain is continually in that mode of learning how to speak, to hear, what to watch and how we learned to THINK and be aware of our cognitive strategies in our [first] ***native language***.

Consider the following proposed 200-module training regimen [given below] for a year-long deep plunge *off the deeper sort of deep ends* into [learning to ***think like a native*** in the Rust programming language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) with a focus on developing programming capabilities and toolchains for working in [predictive fault-tolerance in real-time operating systems [RTOS] for swarm robotics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.09309.pdf) which might include developing the capability to [incorporate the latest thinking research to optimize cognitive radio](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=%22cognitive+radio%22&searchtype=all&source=header) for RT-FT swarm robotics.

Per the ORIGINAL PLAN for our immersive learning plunge, the modules almost appear to be designed to progressively build skills, starting with Rust fundamentals, then moving into lower-level systems concepts crucial for RTOS development, followed by a deeper plunge into embedded and real-time modules that dive deeper into the specifics of constrained environments and deterministic execution ...

***EXCEPT*** this is immersive training that gets more progressively immersive, so we're certainly not going to just STICK WITH the original plan ... we live in an AI-enabled age, so we are going to try to learn by IMMERSION ... that means trying to skim over and grok the entire syllabus in a week or a couple weeks or maybe a month at most ... but we are going to drink from the firehose.

*Of course, it's perfectly okay to revise/extend the syllabus as we go along BUT ...*

## THE ORIGINAL SYLLABUS BRINGS US BACK TO CENTER ...

At some point, when we have really squeezed all the just out of the ol' lemon, we are going to ask our AI assistant an UPDATED VERSION of our original question to furnish us with a new, improved, updated syllabus *although we will keep the old one for reference*.

    "Please develop a 200 module training regimen for a year-long deep dive into learning to program with Rust-Lang, including WASM, the Tauri application toolkit, ROS2 with Rust bindings and other intracies of Rust-Lang and getting closer to the machine. The general objective for this year-long training regimen should be in the realm of developing the capabilities and toolchain for developing fault-tolerant real-time operating systems for swarm robotics."

The POINT of [this learning exercise](https://azynch.github.io/template/2024/03/01/real-time-fault-tolerance.html) is IMMERSION ... and overwhelming ourselves with a progressively better understanding of the topic ... in order to be able to ask progressively better questions ... to ***ACCELERATE the DIFFERENCE!!!***
